# Week-7-Bowling-Scores

I was assigned to create a program that calculates a bowling league's average bowling scores. There were originally 4 scores, but I altered the code to now output 5 scores from each bowler and give the desired average. This was fairly easy to do, and I had a lot of fun getting to put my own original twist on the assignment. Hope you enjoy!
